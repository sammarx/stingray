= stingray

Stingray gem for interfacing with the Riverbed Stingray loadbalancers.


== Notes

== To use the Stingray Gem

1. Install the gem
git clone git@github.com:sammarx/stingray.git
cd stingray
rake build
gem install pkg/stingray-0.0.1.gem

2. Add the following line to your Gemfile:

     gem 'stingray'

3. Create a config/stingray.yml as follows
    url: <base url of stingray API>
    user: <username for authentication>
    password: <password for authentication>

The URL must be the full path to the Stingray REST endpoint -
eg.  
    https://<stingray hostname>:<REST port>/api/tm/1.0/config/active/ 

PUT and DELETE operations will only work over HTTPS.

== Examples

Set up a connection to the Stingray Load Balancer
    
    Stingray.config(YAML.load(File.read('config/stingray.yml'))

Initialize a new pool
    p=Stingray::Pool.new

Create a pool
    p.create('test-pool')

Add a node (server) to the pool.  Takes an array of hosts.  The hosts must be reachable from the Load Balancer.  
    p.add_nodes_to_pool('[test1.example.com, test2.example.com]')

Save the pool.  This sends a PUT request to the REST API.  No changes to the pool will be commited until the pool is saved.
    p.save 

List all existing pools
    p.pools => ["test-pool"]

Get a pool
    p.pool('test-pool')

Delete a node (server) from the pool.  Takes an array of hosts. 
    p.delete_nodes_from_pool('[test2.example.com]')

Delete a pool.  This is an immediate action.
    p.delete
